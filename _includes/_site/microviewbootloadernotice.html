<p class="info" style="background-color:#fff7ae;">To the folks that are receiving broken MicroViews over the next few days and weeks: We are <strong>*really*</strong> sorry to have messed up your first impressions of SparkFun, Geek Ammo and the awesome <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1516846343/microview-chip-sized-arduino-with-built-in-oled-di">MicroView</a>. We are going to make it right and will be shipping a replacement Microview for every defective unit that was shipped. For those of you who backed the Microview Kickstarter you will be receiving an email by September 12th to let you know if you were or were not shipped a defective unit. We are still trying to establish how much units are affected. The worst case scenario is 1,934 units need to be replaced outright. If you are part of the defective batch you will receive two units: one that has a broken bootloader (now and in the coming days) and one that works (by the beginning of November). Please read the official notice <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1516846343/microview-chip-sized-arduino-with-built-in-oled-di/posts/959475">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/1575">here</a>. For a quick DIY fix while waiting for the replacements, please read <a href="http://makezine.com/2014/08/21/how-to-fix-your-broken-microview/">How to Fix Your Broken MicroView - Make:<a/></p>
