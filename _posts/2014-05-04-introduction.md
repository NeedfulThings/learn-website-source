### What is MicroView?

The MicroView is a tiny chip-sized [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) with a built in OLED display. An Arduino is a tool for making tiny computers (MicroControllers) that can interact with the physical world. The MicroView is controlled with the Arduino programming language which can be programmed using the free Arduino IDE.

Like most Arduinos, the MicroView makes it easy to interact with a variety of sensors and control actuators (like motors and relays). Unlike most Arduinos, the MicroView has a built in OLED display that makes it easy to see what's going on inside your Arduino without having to connect it to a computer.

### Why MicroView?

Being MicroView shares the hallmark traits of the Arduino, namely being inexpensive, cross platform and opensource.

The MicroView distinguishes itself from other Arduinos by being the easist to use Arduino ever. Utilising it's beautiful OLED display; the MicroView is the first Arduino to ship with built-in tutorials that teach you the basics of Arduino and electronics.

In addition to the built-in tutorials, we've also built a cross platform course that runs on iPad, Microsoft Surface and modern Web Browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux. 

The course takes you step by step through building a 11 different circuits including:

- Blinking LEDs and creating different colors on an RGB LED.
- Getting readings from a potentiometer (a fancy name for a knob). 
- Taking the input from a push button.
- Sensing Temperature and Light
- Controlling actuators relays, motors & servos
- Making sound


The MicroView's pins have standard spacing meaning they're both DIP (dual inline package) and breadboard compatible.
